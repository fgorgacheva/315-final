## ITERATION 1 NOTES

*********************************************
**    THOUGHTS FROM PREVIOUS PROTOTYPES    **
*********************************************
The most successful prototype was the obscure mysterious prototype4 in which players were not given the answers but the answer is clearly there. They must act quickly and think upon the initial clue/message they were displayed. I wanted to create a bigger game with different challenges that would include puzzles the players have to figure out how to solve and connecting them by making it so each item obtain from solving the puzzle is used to solve the next one. As for the final level design, I want to make the players have to make a moral decision but one that might not be expected (like if they feed the carrot to the bunny, it'll do something tht will force the player to kill the bunny, bt if they just kill it, then we can never know what would happen, open ended).

"Unexpectation" is usually successful in keeping players on the edge of their seats and to keep them thinking. Some levels are designed to make the player fail so they have to try again to find the answer, each playthrough allows them to understand what they have to do better.



**********************
**    HYPOTHESIS    **
**********************
How far can players go without explicit instructions in various scenarios? Do players prefer to put two and two together on their own? Will they keep trying if they feel like the answer is closer and closer?

- LVL1: find house and figure out you have to unlock it to get what's inside, give player incentive to explore and find out the answer alone
- LVL2: Mummies duplicate at a slower rate than the bunnies do in prototype4 because it's in a maze, the answer isn't obvious and will essentially force the player to get consequences on the first playthrough, forcing them to learn from consequences 



**********************
**      DESIGN      **
**********************
- LVL1: sword hidden in house, find key to get the sword
- LVL2: sword obtain previously will allow to get through next level, use sword to kill all mummies, last to die will drop a flashlight
- LVL3: use the flashlight to keep the monster away, light is the answer, find te light switch to annihilate the monster, it will drop a knife and a carrot
- LVL4: use either the carrot or the knife to kill the bunny, the final decision to make



**********************
**  PLAYTEST NOTES  **
**********************
- everyone likes exploring and solving things on their own. instructions make things too quick and too boring, there's no challenge there. 
- the variety and diversity of level designs keep things interesting so that patterns in thinking don't repeat, connection between the levels isn't clear enough, maybe hide the environment of the maze inside the house so on the outside it fit with environment 1, but inside alludes to environment 2.
- mystery keeps things interesting 



***************************
**    FOLLOW UP NOTES    **
***************************
the biggeest thing is that most people have very different ways of reacting to things presented to them whether it's experience with games, or the way they were raised. For example, everyone always went for the bunny and didn't want to kill them and just watched them wreak havoc. Some prefered to sacrifice themselves to let the bunnies live, some started killing them when they had to pick between the bunnies and their own survival, and one immediately killed the bunny before it duplicated once. That guy had a very different upbringing, he loves animals but he's had to kill many as well so seeing the sword and the bunny was a no brainer for him. But he did mention that his mom, who has a bunny as a pet, would absolutely never even consider killing the bunny.

So, given that, there's only so much i can do to adapt the game to everyone's experience. Some will want to explore and find the key, some saw the house and said "where's the key, I don't understand what I have to do because i'm at the hosue and nothing is happening". All i can do, which is what i aim for with this game, is to play on human psychology as much as possible to guide them through the levels.
